            <p style="text-align: justify;">All of us have experiences which have taught us a thing or two. All of us have had some sort of training whether on the job, in life or formal education. All of this combined with the spiritual gifts we are given by the Holy Spirit make us very special people indeed. In studying the book of Ephesians we come to:</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ephesians 2:1-10 And you <em>He made alive, </em>who were dead in trespasses and sins, in which you once walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit who now works in the sons of disobedience, among whom also we all once conducted ourselves in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, just as the others. But God, who is rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us, even when we were dead in trespasses, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved), and raised <em>us </em>up together, and made <em>us </em>sit together in the heavenly <em>places </em>in Christ Jesus, that in the ages to come He might show the exceeding riches of His grace in <em>His </em>kindness toward us in Christ Jesus. For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; <em>it is </em>the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast.</strong></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Interesting to note how we were, then what God did in love through Christ Jesus. So is that it? NO! We have the awesome privilege to do good works! Maybe you may not think you are equipped or talented or even blessed with a special skill and feel guilty about past sins. But the Word says firstly that He has forgiven us of out past and secondly we can do good works.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>10 For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them.</strong></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">God has a plan for your life. One to give you a future and a hope (Jer. 29:11)</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>For I know the plans I have for you," says the LORD. "They are plans for good and not for disaster, to give you a future and a hope.</strong> (NLT)</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">He promises to work everything out together for good. This includes all of your past experiences and knowledge, He will work it for good works.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Roman 8:28-31</strong></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>And we know that God causes everything to work together for the good of those who love God and are called according to his purpose for them; For God knew his people in advance, and he chose them to become like his Son, so that his Son would be the firstborn, with many brothers and sisters. And having chosen them, he called them to come to him. And he gave them right standing with himself, and he promised them his glory. What can we say about such wonderful things as these? If God is for us, who can ever be against us?</strong></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Don’t let the enemy rob you of the joy of service. You have a lot to offer and you have been equipped for service. Seek the Lord for where and how He wants you to serve. He only requires your faithfulness, your loyalty.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>1 Corinthians 4: 2 &nbsp;Moreover it is required in stewards that one be found faithful.</strong></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Prayer:</em></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Father God, Lord Jesus, Holy Spirit; I come before you today. Here I am use my hands use my feet in your service. Make me a blessing that through my life and my past others may be led to you, Make my whole life reflect your goodness and mercy. May others see in me your truth, compassion, hope, future and promises of your plans for them. May my life be the YES and AMEN that others seek. May my service bring a confirmation of your everlasting love.&nbsp; In Jesus name…Amen</em></p>	</div>
