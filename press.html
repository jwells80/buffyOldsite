            I recently received your "Reflections" CD and have been listening to it.  BTW, thanks for autographing it for me, it will always be a cherished part of my vast CD collection!  Great CD, great voice. I don't know if I'm imagining this, but I think I can hear diverse influences, seamlessly melded into a unique, soulful vocal style, all your own.  Sometimes I hear a little bit of Aretha, other times a little bit of Babs (a great singer, but I wish she kept her politics to her self).  My favorites so far are "I Go To The Rock" and "His Eye Is On The Sparrow" but there are no weak cuts.  Is that Kim on drums? The production is fantastic!	</blockquote>

            Now that's how to start a gospel CD! because you can't go wrong with the Dottie Rambo classic 'I Go To The Rock', a song genetically programmed to get even the tardiest foot tapping.<br><br>
    And it's the up tempo numbers that not only grab you the hardest but which give Ms St. Johns voice a chance to shine. there's a gritty edge to the likes of 'Operator' that is missing from the jazzier, mellower numbers like 'That Voice'.<br><br>
    I'd give a shout out to the backing singers but due to a paucity of credits I can't. Same goes for the melodic guitar lines on 'The Blood Will Never Lose Its Power'. With some judicious use of the programme button you'll end up with a delightful gospel / praise CD. Just make sure you leave the acapella 'His Eye Is On The Sparrow' till the end, for maximum impact.<br><br>

    How wonderful to hear from you and to hear of how the LORD is using you.<br>
    I've often wondered what God is doing with you.  I will look into how your CD can be promoted and spread.  You are very gifted -- and certainly<br>
    courageous in your ministry. May our Savior continue to empower and protect you with the fullness of His grace.<br><br>
