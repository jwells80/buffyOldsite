                            <p>Buffy St. John was born in Youngstown, Ohio and was raised under the influence of legendary evangelist Kathryn Kuhlman. Buffy began singing at the age of eight with Kuhlman's Concert Choir under the direction of Dr. Arthur Metcalf. Dr. Metcalf gave Buffy her first vocal training.<br>
    From this early age, Buffy knew that God had placed a call on her life, yet, as a result of child abuse and other issues, she spent many years running from God and his call. During this time she traveled Europe as a background singer for R &amp; B great Nancy Holloway. Later as a solo artist, Buffy then toured extensively through Southeast Asia and Japan as a featured artist in clubs and other concert venues.<br><br>
    Buffy finally returned her life to the Lord in 1992 and began singing as part of the worship team at Hope Chapel in Hermosa Beach, California. It is from there that she started her Christian music ministry.<br><br>
    Now a resident of Springfield, Missouri, Buffy sings and preaches on the foreign mission field and in churches and other Christian settings in the United States. She is married to Kim Stensrud, an accomplished drummer, who she met at Hope Chapel.<br><br>
    A &quot;historical story&quot; in music of how God has dealt with Buffy St. John in her life, Reflections is Buffy's first solo Gospel CD release. Each track has been carefully selected with this in mind. The CD &quot;reflects&quot; how Christ has been, and is, Buffy's foundation, closest friend, and savior and Lord. Even while she was straying from the flock, He was watching over her to bring her back. His grace knows no bounds!<br><br>
    TRACK ONE—“I Go To The Rock”— Buffy brings her own unique style to this classic by the legendary Dottie Rambo. It's impossible to sit still while listening to this great song!<br><br>
    TRACK TWO—“That Voice”— offers a full range of her vocal prowess, from sultry, silky jazz feel to her full Gospel punch.<br><br>
    TRACK THREE—“I Must Tell Jesus”— Between the mellow beginning and ending Buffy's powerful voice erupts as she sings of her great desire to share her deepest feelings with her closest friend, Jesus.<br><br>
    TRACK FOUR—“I Still Believe in the Church”— Buffy's treatment of this ode to the Body of Christ is pure gospel combined with the jazz flair she developed from her years singing in secular venues.<br><br>
    TRACK FIVE—“Operator”— “Operator, give me Jesus” is a toe-tapping, hand-clapping treat. It's up tempo and power packed all the way through!<br><br>
    TRACK SIX—“That's Why They Call It Grace”— This song is a tribute to the grace of God which has carried Buffy throughout her life. It builds from smooth to crescendo after crescendo as Buffy sings her praise to the Lord.<br><br>
    TRACK SEVEN—“The Lamb Has Overcome”— Buffy shows the full range of her dynamic voice as she belts out this song of celebration written by Carol Cymbala, director of the world-famed Brooklyn Tabernacle Choir.<br><br>
    TRACK EIGHT—“Oh Happy Day”— Everyone is familiar with this classic and Buffy sings it with great joy and gratitude to the Lord in her voice—you'll want to sing along!<br><br>
    TRACK NINE—“The Blood Will Never Lose Its Power”— The great gospel artist, Andrae Crouch, wrote this magnificent worship hymn glorifying the supremacy and unchanging nature of God. Buffy's voice has a sense of awe and wonder as she praises God with this song.<br><br>
    TRACK TEN—“His Eye Is On The Sparrow”— Buffy's moving acappella rendition of this wonderful hymn of assurance will send chills down your spine and tears to your eyes.</p>
