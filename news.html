                  recognize the church of today. In an effort to be relevant to the changing times
                  somewhere along the way some of the church's doctrine and theology has been watered
                  down. Compromise has slipped in and "tolerance" has reared its ugly head to relegate
                  Jesus Christ to a has-been Savior no longer relevant with the changing times. Too
                  busy trying to please the masses and keep the coffers topped off more and more
                  leaders are watering down the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Those who attempt to stay true
                  to the Bible are leaving the pastorate burnt out, driven out or broken; some have
                  even lost their faith. Why is this happening? What sinister plot is unfolding? A
                  must read for all who seek self examination, and an eye opener for those who have
                  wondered why.</span><span style="font-family: Times;">&nbsp;</span> </span></p>

            It seems that Buffy St. John has a passion and an enthusiasm to match in everything she does.
            Buffy has been making modifications at home and recently Buffy went greener with the purchase of
            a total electric car in an effort to not only do her part in reducing her carbon footprint, but
            cut her dependence on petroleum and the ever changing gas prices.<br><br>
            When asked how she likes it, she stated "I love it! I zip around all day in it and plug it in at
            night!"<br><br>

            Well, here I am. After considerable health issues and an ice storm that cripple our city (we had
            no power for 12 days) God has proven Himself faithful. Did we ever doubt it?<br><br>
            I'm looking forward to getting back to vocalizing, rehearsals and getting back into the
            mainstream of things. I have certainly missed doing what I was created to do.<br><br>
            Thank you for all your prayers. As you know the cancer is gone, the surgery for a deviated
            septum on Jan. 5th went well and I'm breathing a whole lot better. The therapy for my vocal
            chords has been going well and I look forward to getting back on the road. I've missed you all
            and can't wait to see you in person.<br><br>
            I'm also looking forward to getting back in the studio and recording another CD.<br>
            For 2007 one of our goals is to get our WEB-TV programming up and going. We hope to do a news
            show, Bible Study show, and a music video/interview show with local Christian bands. If you are
            not on our mailing list to receive our newsletter, please send me an e-mail with your postal

            Boy am I glad there are praying people out there! I went in for a routine physical in Sept. The
            doctor found a mole that looked suspicious and sent me to have it biopsied. So on my wedding
            anniversary (Nov. 10th) I went to the dermatologist for a biopsy. While at the dermatologist I
            requested he look at a growth on my arm.<br><br>
            The dermatologist thought that the mole was malanoma and the growth basel cell carcinoma. He
            biopsied both sites.<br>
            The results? The mole benign. The growth on my arm, pre-malanoma. We scheduled surgery.A
            procedure called MOHS was performed (I got to watch the whole thing and it was cool) Four
            stitches on the inside and eleven on the outside later, I am happy to report that the pathology
            report came back this morning, clean. They got it all. Thank GOD! I get my stitches out on
            Friday.<br>
            Thank you for all who lift me up in prayer! Keep Praying - God listens AND answers! </div>

            Wow! What a trip! I'm recovering from the trip to Nicaragua. It was awesome! Over 50 salvations,
            10 miracle healings, Praise The Lord! It made daily, random water and electrical shortages all
            worthwhile. The concert for the youth was an overwhelming success. The attendee ages were from 8
            years old to 32 (with a few older folks in the mix).<br><br>
            As I travel throughout the world, I find that all youth have the same desires, concerns,
            problems and needs. It was an incredible honor to be used by God to minister to those needs, to
